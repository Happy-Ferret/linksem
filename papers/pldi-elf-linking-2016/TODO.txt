abstract

fix up the intro claims

5.2 second para:  make clear that this is what happens when linking
hello.c with our spec (following what happens in reality), and for
each we describe the relevant parts of our formal model. 


where does the explicit linker impl vs linker spec discussion belong?


supplementary material?
     make non-personally-identifiable


fold 6.2 Module systems into the 6.1 text after Cardelli  (and bump
6.1 to 6)


bump 7.1 to 7

orient the 7 opening (currently "Several avenues for further work in
this area are apparent. We now discuss them") to the fact that this
work enables a bunch of other important and interesting things

and squish 7 down



a bunch of local polish
(including use of citations as nouns, which many americans are
allergic to)
