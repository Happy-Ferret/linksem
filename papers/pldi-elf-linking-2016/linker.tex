\section{Linker-checker}

is both a linker and a link checker.

It is invoked the same way as the GNU linker, supporting the same command-line options.

However, its output file (named with \textsf{-o}, or else \textsf{a.out}) may already exist.
If invoked with an existing output file,
it checks equivalence of the memory image it generates
with the memory image embodied by the output file.
FIXME: also do post-load check: start the program up in a ptrace'd state 
and compare each word of the image.

Currently the equivalence function is ``equality modulo don't-cares'': the 
memory image is allowed to make certain content (such as padding) as arbitrary.
However, other details, all the way down to address assignment 

a reference implementation optimised for readability
and portability

EXAMPLES of the liftable-out portions of the spec 
e.g.\ detailing symbol binding.

a test oracle.

a basis for reasoning? WHAT can we argue here?


To allow per-linker divergences, 
the linker is factored to invoke 
linker ``personality functions'' corresponding to 
the loosenesses identified earlier (\S\ref{sec:looseness})

\begin{itemize}

\item seen ordering

\item placing orphans

\item simplifying relocations

\item concretising padding etc.

\item concretising support features (order etc.)

\item ELF headers, program headers etc.

\end{itemize}
